# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
 This analysis shows the performance of the school district's testing results in math and reading for each school.  It exhibits the highest and the lowest performing schools and summarizes the results categorically by school budget, school size, and school type. 

## Purpose of Analysis
 Standardized testing in math and reading are common markers to measure the education level of students in public/charter schools.  This particular district wants to understand what factors could play a major part in determining these results whether it be funding, student size, or district/charter school.  With this newfound data, district board directors can decide what key factors are important to improve the education, or test results rather, for this particular district. 

## Results
 During the first run of results, it was apparent to the district officials the ninth grade reading and math scores were skewed. It was necessary to remove all Thomas High School's 9th grade math and reading scores to get an accurate picture of what was happening at each high school. As one would expect, the outcomes were different. 

During initial analyses it came to light that the ninth grade scores were problematic for Thomas High School.  Those test scores had to be removed and the analyses redone to paint a more accurate picture. The new data saw little to no difference as shown in the before and after photos below for district summary:

# Summary

But the results show that no significant changes ocurred to the final metric points.  Only significant points are that percentages deviated about .5% and grades deviated about .1 points
